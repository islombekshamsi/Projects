# Mini Tic Tac Toe

Hello fellow programmers!

I decided to build very beginner friendly tic tac toe using C++. 

In order to make it a little more fun, I added little logic to the computer choice, particularly it is done in three simple steps:

1) Win if you can
2) Block the user from winning
3) Random positioning

Feel free to have a look and let me know if there are ways this could be simplified.

Happy coding!
