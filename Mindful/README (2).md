# Mindful

Howdy!

This project was made at Penn State hackathon presented by ACM club by me and my teammate. 
It as an AI-powered health and wellness app designed to allow users log their mood and notes. One of the cool things of the app is that you can set your ambiance based on mood, answer 10 questions for thorough AI analysis, and implement 3 science backed breathing techniques designed to relax your nervous system.

Feel free to test it out, reach out or collaborate!

Happy Coding!

p.s. it is free to get your own api key, so i didnt put in mine and replaced it with "your-api-code".
