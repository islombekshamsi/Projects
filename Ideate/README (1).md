# Ideate
Hello everyone!

I have decided to build my first project in SwiftUI - an advanced note taking app with tasks.

Reason behind the name is that I have originally planned to make it for those sudden moments when you get an idea for a startup and for it not to be lost you can easily write it down in the app and initialize it by brainstorming, settling the difficulty, even sketching on your phone, and choosing your own color palette.

Moreover, in order to realize your ideas, I have added tasks section so that you will be able to create tasks for certain projects and remove it when completed.

Also, I was completing this project for Swift Student Challenge and had a lot of classes so didn't have enough time to separate the files in MVVM fashion.

I am open to collaborations.

Feel free to suggest any improvements!

Happy coding!

## Update
I have applied major changes to Ideate. Firstly, Ideate became AI-powered startup note taking app using OpenRouter API (which is free of charge and you can easily your API key by checking their site out). Next, task view has been modified completely by making it more user-friendly. Lasty, I have made sure that sketch area is extendable i.e. you can increase the area of drawing/sketching.
