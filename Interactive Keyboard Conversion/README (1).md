# Keyboard Conversion

This brief function consists of dictionary and some loops in order to solve a problem that occured to me during the interview.

I wanted to jot down some notes while writing and while interviewer was speaking I didn't have the time nor I looked at what I was writing, but I know the placement of each key. Turns out I wrote all my text in Russian and didn't want to conver the text one by one, decided to code it out to ease my life.

Anyway, I hope you will be able to use it too.

Happy Coding!
