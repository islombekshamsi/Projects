# Instagram Saved Section UI

Howdy folks!

Recently, I have been learning Swift and decided to have a light SwiftUI exercise, I decided to recreate the Instagram Saved Section Design. 

It is pretty similar and I changed some of the buttons.

Feel free to have a look and let me know if there are ways this could be simplified

Happy coding!
