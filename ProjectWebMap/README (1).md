# WebMaps 

Howdy, everyone!

I have developed world webmaps mainly including features such as graphical population of each country, information about Uzbekistan (my motherland) mountains and lakes.

But here's where the real magic happens. Simply grab a text file, copy and paste it into AI-powered tool, and watch as it effortlessly transforms the data into a stunning webmap tailored to your country of choice. The best part? No need to tinker with the code, unless you're feeling adventurous and want to add your personal touch.

Imagine having this awe-inspiring project in your portfolio, showcasing your mastery of data handling, your expertise in packages like folium and pandas, and your knack for creating jaw-dropping geographical maps. It's the perfect way to dazzle potential employers and stand out from the crowd.

Happy Coding!
