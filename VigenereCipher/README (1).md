# VigenÃ¨re Cipher

Howdy folks!

This mini project of mine contains a encryption and decryption function that stayed unbroken for centuries. As the name suggests, it was named after Blaise de VigenÃ¨re; however, it was initially developed by Giovan Battista Bellaso.

It lets you choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt. Then you give it a key, which turns the text into a bunch of gibberish.

You can consider it as the early version of symmetric encryption, where there is a single public key.

P.S this code is for russian words/sentences only

Happy coding!
