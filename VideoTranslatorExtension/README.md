# Video Translator Extension

Howdy!

As I was preparing for my computer science exam, I realized that one of the videos related to exam preparation wasn't in English and Youtube sadly didn't have a translator for that. That's why I decided to build an Indian to English video translator subtitles. Did it work? Yes, I still use it lol.

Feel free to modify, reach out or collaborate!

Happy Coding!

p.s. it is free to get your own api key, so i didnt put in mine and replaced it with "your-api-code".
